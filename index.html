        <h2>Using the API</h2>

        <h3>Canvas</h3>
        <p>Canvas is an abstraction of the UI layer. Every UI Object that needs to be drawn must be added to the canvas first</p>

        <h3>UI Prefab</h3>
        <p>This is a collection of helper methods to facilitate faster UI creation. Currently CreateText and CreateButton help the user create a complex objects in a few lines of code</p>

        <h3>UI Object</h3>
        <p>A UIObject is the simplest UI element, it takes in a renderable, and is capable of drawing that renderable</p>
        
        <h3>Clickable UI Object</h3>
        <p>A UIObject that is capable of handling a click event. This class assumes that the renderable it uses will have an accurate position and size to be used as a button.</p>

        <h3>UI Object Collection</h3>
        <p>A collection of UI Object all being drawn together</p>
        
        <h3>UI Dropdown</h3>
        <p>A UIObject that is a drop down, and the user can select between multiple choices</p>
        
        <h3>UI Toggle</h3>
        <p>A UIObject that is a toggle, it will cycle through all the given choices</p>
